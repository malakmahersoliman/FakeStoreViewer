##  My Learning Journey

This project started as a practice assignment and evolved as I explored more Android architecture concepts. Here's how I progressed:

1.  **Started by following the session instructions** to fetch and display data from FakeStore API
2.  **Searched for the best folder structure** to organize `model`, `network`, `ui`, and `viewmodel`
3.  **Improved the UI** step-by-step with Jetpack Compose and Material 3
4.  **Introduced a sealed wrapper class (`ResultState`)** to cleanly handle `Loading`, `Success`, and `Error` states
5.  **Tested and polished the user experience** by showing loading indicators and retry buttons
6.  **Learned how to read JSON responses**, create matching `data class`, define Retrofit interfaces, and build a reusable Retrofit client
7.  **Created a ViewModel** with coroutine logic and exposed clean state to the UI
8.  **Finalized project using Compose UI best practices**, `NavController`, `TopAppBar`, and more

##  Final Thoughts

This project taught me how to:

- Connect UI with live network data using Retrofit and ViewModel
- Build scalable and reactive apps using Jetpack Compose
- Apply clean architecture and separation of concerns across `model`, `network`, `ui`, and `viewmodel`
- Enhance user experience with responsive state management using sealed classes (`ResultState`)
